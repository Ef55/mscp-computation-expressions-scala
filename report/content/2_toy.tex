\newcommand{\rob}[0]{\textsc{Rob}}

We will now introduce, \rob{} a tiny toy example,
tailored to show multiple aspects of such DSLs.

\rob{} is a fictional robot living on a toric grid which can be programmed with some assembly,
and we will be building a DSL in Scala for it.
We won't define said assembly, as the focus of this project is on the DSL definition,
and is not concerned with the compilation of the DSL into assembly.
We instead define the AST which will be generated by the DSL in \cref{fig:rob-ast}.

\begin{figure*}
\lstinputlisting[language=scala]{code/rob/ast.scala}
\caption{\rob{}'s AST.}
\label{fig:rob-ast}
\end{figure*}

In particular, we would like the DSL to allow to write such a program:
\lstinputlisting[language=scala]{code/rob/motivating_example.scala}

We will also assume, for future examples,
that a \scalasnippet{goto} function can be implemented, 
which takes two coordinates and moves \rob{} to this position.
